a confident female podcaster with a strong resemblance to Princess Leia from Star Wars, sporting a signature hairstyle featuring a pair of curled buns on either side of her head, wearing a pair of silver stud earrings and a fitted white shirt with a high collar, sitting in a dimly lit studio with a microphone positioned in front of her, surrounded by soundproofing panels and shelves stacked with books and vinyl records, her facial features defined by high cheekbones, a small nose, and expressive brown eyes that convey a sense of authority and charisma, her skin radiating a warm, golden glow under the soft studio lighting.
